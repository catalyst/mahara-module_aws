# AWS SDK - Moodle Plugin

A mahara plugin containing Amazon's SDK for PHP.

To use the SDK, simply include the autoloader contained within this plugin.

```php
require_once($CFG->dirroot . '/module/aws/sdk/aws-autoloader.php');
```

If you are writing a plugin that will use this SDK, it is recommended that you add this to the plugin's version.php:

```php
$plugin->dependencies = array(
    'module_aws' => 2017030100
);
```

## Why does this exist? ##

There is a growing collection of various moodle plugins that require these AWS libraries in order to work.
We don't want to have multiple copies of these libraries bundled into each plugin, firstly because they
are quite large, but also because it can cause issues with library namespaces and php auto loading.

Plugins that depend on this library are:

https://github.com/catalyst/moodle-tool_s3logs

https://github.com/catalyst/moodle-tool_objectfs


## Supported Moodle Versions

## Installation
